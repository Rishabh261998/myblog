## About Me

Hi there, I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing a major in **Maths and Scientific Computing** at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur**. I am intereseted in the field of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. Deep nets drive me crazy. I was always fascinated by their sophisticated structure and loved how they are used to attain `SOTA` results for so many real world problems. 

In the past I have worked on a project `Case Judgement Prediction for Supreme Court Cases`in the field of **Legal AI** under [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/). Currently I am working on a project  `Prior Case Retrieval` under him.  I am also working on a project with an open source organization [ArviZ](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz) as part of [GSoC'21](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Apart from these I am also trying to extend my deep learning knowledge and not just restrict it to `NLP`. 

In my spare time, I like solving puzzles, binging anime and playing multi-player games with my friends. Some of my favourite anime of mine are FMAB, Attack on Titan, One Piece. I also love playing cricket and table tennis. In my free time I also love participating in competitive programming competiitions.
